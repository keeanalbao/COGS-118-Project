        "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project.\n",
        "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
        "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
        "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
        "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
        "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

The data at hand represents state wide customers and the detailed description of their purchase at a particular season. With the data, the project looks to utilize K-means clustering as a means to group customers. By doing so, when a new customer makes a purchase, they can be accurately cateogorized into a group and thus allowing companies to directly market to that customer. Silhouette analysis will be used to ensure accuracy of our clusters. In order to categorize, k-nearest neighbors will be used alongside K-Means.\n",

Even though physical store visits and sales for many product categories are still higher than those of online retailers, the number of online shoppers and e-commerce revenue consistently grows every year<a name=\"radu\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#radunote).\n",

        "\n",
        "This problem can be quantified by the various features in the data (e.g. age, gender, item purchased, purchase amount), and by using K-Means Clustering in order to assign each data point to a cluster by using distance metrics such as Euclidean distance, and then creating labels for each cluster to differentiate them.\n",
        "\n",

        "This problem can be replicated using the same dataset and techniques since initializing K-Means centroids is done randomly, so there may be some different results for the groups. On the other hand, the problem can be replicated using a completely different dataset containing different features, as well as a different clustering algorithm. This may lead to different results as well."
